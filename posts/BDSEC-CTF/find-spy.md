By googling part of the instructions, I soon found an [article](https://www.newagebd.net/article/93985/bangladesh-cops-soldier-prosecuted-for-spying-for-indias-raw) talking about an Indian Soldier who was allegedly working for an Indian external intelligence unit. 

The name of the soldier was Shah Newaz and he was arrested on October 25, 2018
