## 5x5 Crypto
### Difficulty: Medium

Following the clue, I ended up with a 5 by 5 grid. It asked for `K` to be excluded.

> A  B  C  D  E
> 
> F  G  H  I  J
> 
> L  M  N  O  P
> 
> Q  R  S  T  U
> 
> V  W  X  Y  Z

Coordinates to get the digits are given as row (-) to column (|). 

1-3 = `C`

4-4 = `T` 

2-1 = `F`

 {  = `{`
 
4-4 = `T`

2-3 = `H`

4-5 = `U`

3-2 = `M`

1-2 = `B`

4-3 = `S`

 _  = `_`
 
4-5 = `U`

3-5 = `P`

 }  = `}`
 
Combining them gives `CTF{THUMBS_UP}`

flag `CTF{THUMBS_UP}`
