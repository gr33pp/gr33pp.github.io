Looking at the challenge description, the most striking clue is the ```Why should you when you have your keyboard?```. I tried decrypting as Caesar cipher and it didn't prove much of help.

Trying to search if anything keyboard encrypt exists on dcode.fr and i found one, "Keyboard Shift Cipher" and it did the job of deciphering.
