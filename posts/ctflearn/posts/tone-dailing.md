### Tone Dailing 

### Difficulty = Easy

We are given ```you_know_what_to_do.wav```. On playing the sound, you will see that its phone calling sound. Some research led me to identify phone dailing as DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency). I tried to manually decode using my phone as sample but it wasn't that accurate

### Decoding

using dtmf.netlify.app, i was able to decrypt the dtmf and get the coresponding digits. 

```
0001s 66...77..................
0002s ..........88...44........
0003s ....................77...
0004s 00.......................
0005s .....11...00...88........
0006s ....................11...
0007s 00...11..................
0008s ..........99...77........
0009s ....................11...
0010s 11...00..................
0011s ..........11...22...33...
0012s .........................
0013s 66...77..................
0014s ..........88...22........
0015s ....................88...
0016s 99.......................
0017s .....88...00.............
0018s ...............88...44...
0019s .........................
0020s 77...99..................
0021s ..........77...11........
0022s ....................88...
0023s 22.......................
0024s .....66...55.............
0025s ...............88...00...
0026s .........................
0027s 77...22..................
0028s ..........88...99........
0029s ....................11...
0030s 22...55...

Decoded: 67847010810197110123678289808479718265807289125

```

Looking at the way the numbers came up, I added spaces to separate them. I know there might be errors but a trial isn't bad.

```67 84 70 108 101 97 110 123 67 82 89 80 84 79 71 82 65 80 72 89 125```

Looks like decrypting this to letters will go more with the decimal to letter function on cyberchef.

CTFlean{CRYPTOGRAPHY}.. As i mentioned, room for error. Its very easy to correct the flag and add "r"

Flag ```CTFlearn{CRYPTOGRAPHY}```

Done
